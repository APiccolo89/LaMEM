* SNES uses standard prefix

* MFFD Jacobian is activated after a fixed number of Picard iterations.
  Number of Picard iterations is provided via option -npicard 3

* MFFD Jacobian options are set via prefix -fd_

* Jacobian linear solver is controlled via prefix -js_ 
  From now on only "coupled" velocity-pressure iterations are supported.

* Stokes preconditioner type is selected via option -pstokes,
  which can currently assume the following values:

   [1] -pstokes al - augmented Lagrangian (artificial compressibility)
        KSP prefix is -al_
        Penalty parameter is set via option -pgamma 1e3 (applied to the viscosity scaling matrix).
        
   [2] -pstokes bf - block factorization (Schur complement based a.k.a. fieldsplit).
        PC prefix -bf_
        Option setting pattern is standard for PETSc fieldsplit preconditioner,
        unless Galerking Geometric multigrid is selected for the velocity.
        In this case multigrid PC is controlled via prefix -gmg_
        Coarse solver KSP prefix is -crs_
        Selecting velocity multigrid is done with the flag -velgmg
        
   [3] -pstokes mg - coupled velocity-pressure Galerking Geometric multigrid
        (same as above -gmg_ and -crs_)
