Short note on using integers in Petsc-based applications (e.g. LaMEM)
=====================================================================

0) To check what type of integer is currently employed by PETSc use the following statement:

#if defined(PETSC_USE_64BIT_INDICES)

#else

#endif

1) Wherever integers are used in the code, they should be declared as PetscInt

2) If MPI functions are explicitly called (e.g. MPI_Comm_size), then their integer parameters should be declared as PetscMPIInt

3) PETSc also provides MPIU_INT type definition that should be used (instead of MPI_INT) for sending/receiving PetscInt variables

4) One should explicitly take care of integer type definition where it may be important (e.g. Paraview Int32 Int64 data types);
