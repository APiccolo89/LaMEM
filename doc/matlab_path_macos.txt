On Mac OS matlab executable is not in the path by default.
To make it work on command line you need to add it to path.

Go to /Applications directory and note the actual matlab version you have on your machine 
(appears below as MATLAB_RXXXXy.app).

There is a number of ways to solve this problem: 

	1. Modify path in bash_profile: 
		export PATH=/Applications/MATLAB_RXXXXy.app/bin:$PATH
		
	2. Create symbolic link in /usr/bin directory
		sudo ln -s /Applications/MATLAB_RXXXXy.app/bin/matlab /usr/bin/matlab
		
	3. Create alias in bash_profile:
		alias matlab="/Applications/MATLAB_RXXXXy.app/bin/matlab"

Any of the above methods should work.

NOTE:
 
	If you modify bash_profile, don't forget to restart console to enable changes.
	
	Starting matlab in console on Lion shows a lot of warnings like this: 
	" ... This process is attempting to exclude an item from Time Machine ..."
	It's a well known issue, and it should be just ignored
