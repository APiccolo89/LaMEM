INSTALLATION GUIDE OF LAMEM


[0] INSTALL PETSC

Installation guides of PETSc on different platforms can be found in ../doc/installation/

# Set paths in .bash_profile
export PETSC_DEB=/opt/petsc/petsc-3.5.4-int32-debug
export PETSC_OPT=/opt/petsc/petsc-3.5.4-int32-opt

NOTES:

[1] DEBUG & OPTIMIZED

No more PETSC_DIR and no more switching between the debug and optimized versions with .bash_profile is necessary.
Makefile is now supporting building both versions simultaneously.
type 'make mode=deb all' (or simply 'make all', mode=deb is the default) to build everything in debug mode
type 'make mode=opt all' to build everything in optimized mode

[2] GIT

Download LaMEM from BitBucket:
git clone https://UserName@bitbucket.org/bkaus/lamem.git LaMEM/
replace UserName by your bitbucket username


[3] VIEW ENVIRONMENT

type 'make mode=deb print' or 'make mode=opt print' to view your environmental variables.
if PETSC_OPT or PETSC_DEB are not properly set you will get an error message such as:
Makefile:58: /opt/petsc/petsc-3.5.4-int32-opt/conf/variables: File or directory not found

[4] TESTS

Tests are also separated. In the tests directory:
type 'make mode=deb check' to perform tests in debug mode.
type 'make mode=opt check' or (or simply 'make check', mode=opt is the default) to perform tests in optimized mode.

Take care that mode=deb is the default for LaMEM, and mode=opt is the default for tests.
