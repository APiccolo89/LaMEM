This folder contains a few setups for LaMEM, which are created within MATLAB.
Creating such a geometry involves 3 steps:

a) Create a partitioning file, by adding the command-line option "-mode save_grid"
   ../../bin/opt/LaMEM -ParamFile <FileName.dat> -mode save_grid
 
b) Run the MATLAB script, while making sure that the partitioning file is specified
   All examples in this directory also create a VTK file of the input geometry and 
   temperature structure, so you can check it is correct, before running a simulation.
   This file is called VTK_ModelSetup_paraview_binary.vtr

c) Run the LaMEM file, the normal way (or with "-mode normal", which is default)
   ../../bin/opt/LaMEM -ParamFile <FileName.dat>

And as always, you can use Paraview to visualize the files.

If you are a new user of LaMEM, we recommend you look & run the files in the
following order:

1) Subduction2D_FreeSlip_MATLABParticles_Linear_DirectSolver.dat:
   2D subduction setup, in which the slab has a constant (linear) viscosity,
   we employ a free slip upper boundary and a plastic crust.
   Use the MATLAB script CreateMarkers_Subduction_Linear_FreeSlip_parallel.m
   to create the input geometry.
  
2) Subduction3D_FreeSlip_MATLABParticles_Linear_Multigrid.dat:    
   As 1), but with a 3D geometry and a multigrid solver, and with a lower
   resolution (to make this work on smaller machines as well) 

3) Subduction2D_FreeSurface_MATLABParticles_Nonlinear_DirectSolver.dat: 	   
   2D subduction setup, but in this case we also have a free surface, set
   the initial temperature structure in MATLAB (based on halfspace cooling)
   and employ a viscoelastoplastic rheology with both dislocation and 
   diffusion creep (where we also show how to override the default value of
   the activation volume)
