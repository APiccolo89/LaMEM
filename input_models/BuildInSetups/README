This folder contains a few setups for LaMEM, which are build-in setups implying
that you can create the setup within the input file. LaMEM has a few geometrical
objects build in (see /input/lamem_input.dat for a full overview), which you can 
use to construct your own (simple) setup.

Running files with LaMEM is done with:

../../bin/opt/LaMEM -ParamFile <FileName.dat>

And as always, you can use Paraview to visualize the files.

If you are a new user of LaMEM, we recommend you look & run the files in the
following order:

1) FallingBlock_DirectSolver.dat    -> Nondimensional falling block setup (3D)
                                       using direct solvers. 

2) FallingBlock_Multigrid.dat 	    -> Two falling blocks, using a multigrid solver and 
                                       slightly higher resolution.

3) FallingSpheres_Multigrid.dat     -> Ten falling spheres with multigrid (good benchmark)
